Machine Learning Spam Detection

This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. The model uses supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The goal of this project is to build a reliable email classification system using the Spambase dataset from UCI. The system uses logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM algorithms to classify emails, with a target accuracy of 75%-90%. The model was developed using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
